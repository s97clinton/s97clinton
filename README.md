- 👋 Hi, I’m Steven Clinton!
- 👀 I'm interested in using data science to model outcomes in NFL football games.
- 💞️ I like working with Python, but also have a history of working with R, and try to keep both skillsets up to date!
- As of now, my public project setup is a work in progress, but that should change rapidly in the last few days of Oct '26 into November!
